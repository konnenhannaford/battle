### 1. Description  

**What is this project?**  
* An application for users to upload and discover other users remixed music  

**Why this project?**  
* Music production has become alot more common in recent years with more DAW's becoming available and more users gaining access to these tools.  As one of these bedroom producers, I wanted to create an app that allowed for users to post remixes that they make and view those psoted by others.  With the implementation of voiting and compeititons, this type of service could grow for spreading music and growing artist relationships.

* Users who want the ability of sharing their remixes and competing against others


**Lessons learnt?**  
* GraphQL is powerful but requires alot of further practice 
* React has been used so familiarity with this has grown
* Apollo is something I need to practice A LOT as I had countless errors working with it
* Understanding Heroku and how to post
